<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and curious Computer Science student currently pursuing my B.Tech with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am deeply interested in exploring the intersection of technology and intelligence, with a keen focus on building strong foundational skills in programming, data structures, and system design. Alongside my academic work, I actively engage in self-driven learning to stay updated with emerging tech trends.</p>

<p>This summer break, I am focusing on building my skills in full stack web development along with UI/UX design. Iâ€™m also working to strengthen my programming knowledge in Python and deepen my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. As I progress, I plan to apply my knowledge by working on practical projects, contributing to GitHub, and exploring datasets on Kaggle to enhance my learning and visibility in the tech community.</p>

<p>I am highly motivated and disciplined, consistently working toward my goals with a structured approach. With a growing interest in advanced technologies like quantum computing and machine learning, I am open to interdisciplinary learning and collaborative innovation. I believe in continuous improvement and am excited about the journey ahead in tech, both as a student and a future professional.</p>
